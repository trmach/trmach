### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm going to tell you a secret, keep it between us, alright? Them, they do it on purpose, to tease newcomers. First they instruct you to create a separate boot partition, then they tell you not to automount it in fstab, and then they laugh on us when we forget to mount boot before installing a new kernel! Yup, with boot not mounted you can install kernels as many as you want, when you reboot it will still be the old kernel you installed with Gentoo.
